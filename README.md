# Mental-Health-Portal-Web-Crawl-and-Page-Rank--Honors-Capstone-Project
I used a python code, spider.py, which consisted of BeautifulSoup to run a page crawl on betterhelp.com, an online mental health service portal.

Later, I ran a pagerank script, sprank.py, to rank the crawled pages based on link quality. Next, I visualized the link ranks on the command prompt by running spdump.py.

At the very end, I visualized the top 25 links of betterhelp.com using force.html.
